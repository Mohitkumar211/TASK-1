Node.js CI/CD Pipeline 🚀
Welcome to the Node.js CI/CD Pipeline project!
This repository showcases a powerful yet simple continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) setup for a Node.js application, seamlessly automated through GitHub Actions and DockerHub.

✨ Project Highlights
Automated Workflows: Push code to the main branch and watch your app get built, tested, containerized, and pushed to DockerHub — all without lifting a finger!

Dockerized Application: The Node.js app is neatly packaged into a Docker image for consistent and reliable deployments.

Secure Secrets Management: DockerHub credentials are stored securely using GitHub Secrets.

Effortless Testing: Integrated steps to ensure code quality and prepare for future test automation.

Optimized for Speed: Runs on GitHub-hosted Ubuntu environments for lightning-fast builds.

🛠️ Technologies Used

🚀 How It Works
Push to Main Branch: Every push to the main branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow.

Build Process:

Code checkout

Node.js environment setup

Dependency installation

(Optional) Run tests

Build a Docker image of the app
